A simple web vulnerability scanner built using Python and wxPython GUI library.

## Description

This project is a web vulnerability scanner that helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in web applications, specifically targeting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The scanner allows users to enter a URL and performs scans for both XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with and visualize the scanning process.

## Features

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Scanning
- SQL Injection Vulnerability Scanning
- User-friendly GUI using wxPython
- Progress bars for scan visualization
- Display of scan results with details
